EXPENSE TRACKER API

Problem 

Most of the time we find ourselves spending more than we would like to, besides that we might end up spending more on one item or category than another.This can lead to over expenditure or unbalanced spending which is in turn not a good culture in the era where savings are a prequit and standards of living are a bit high resulting from unavoidable circumstances for example the  coronavirus pandemic pandemic.

Solution

With this API one is able to insert their intended budget and expenses and they are able to generate a report either weekly or monthly with the different categories of items spent on with their respective amounts . This report can be viewed in the form of a pie chart or a bar graph showing the details. With this, one can easily identify which individual items or category they have spent on most and adjust accordingly and continuously track their expenditure.
